# Surveys app


On the website you can display all the surveys or the surveys you add to the website and from them you can display only active surveys or only inactive surveys.
You can also sort the surveys on the website.
Each survey on the website has a time frame during which you can respond to the survey.
Each user can respond to active surveys on the website no more than once. A user who did not answer a certain question in the survey will not be able to advance to the next question. After a user has responded to the survey then the number of people who responded to the survey is updated. Any user can also share the surveys and can view the results of inactive surveys.
Only the admin can delete surveys.
When a user creates a survey then the survey is sent to the admin for approval. Only the admin has the option to approve or disapprove a survey. After a user has sent a request to add a survey then he can check the status of the request.
In order for the user to register on the website, he must enter the account creation page and fill in the details. A user with an existing username or email or mobile number will not be able to register for the website.
